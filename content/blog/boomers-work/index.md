When it comes to work, who's got the most energy? GenZ? Millennials? What does the data show?

<em>Harvard Business Review</em> dings some stereotypes:

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Despite the negative stereotypes that older workers have less energy and are less productive, the data shows otherwise. </p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>According to research from the Stanford Center on Longevity, older workers are healthy, have a strong work ethic, are loyal to their employers . . .  Moreover, a London Business School study showed that more people under 45 were exhausted (43%) than those over 45 (35%), with the least exhausted group being those over 60.</p></div>

When I was in my 20s I thought people in their 40s were old and over the hill! (What did I know?) 

I wonder why we fixate on stereotypes instead of seeing individuals. These conceptions/images certainly aren't being created by a 64-year old <a href="https://www.tonal.com/blog/introducing-tony-hortons-new-workouts-with-tonal/" target="blank">Tony Horton</a> or 60-year old <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/tom-cruise-days-off-work-1235278344/" target="blank">Tom Cruise</a>  . . . 

Nor are they created by tech boomers like Lynda Weinman, online advertising guru Leslie Laredo, or the late Steve Jobs. 

I think of energy as being not based on outward display of enthusiasm (which may be more natural to extroverts and can be faked), or based on excitement (a passing feeling-state), but based on an ability to be steady, disciplined, and committed, which is rooted in your volition. 

How strong is your volition? I think of volition as a muscle: it's either toned up and strong or it can be made that way.

So I suppose I would regard energy -- at its root -- as beginning with a choice to exercise volition. 

But I concur with analytics maestro Avinash Kaushik who quipped "All data in aggregate is crap." So "averages" collected on age groups are largely meaningless. 

They can simply spur us to focus on (and truly see) the individual and their merits rather than a blob-like stereotype.
