When it comes to work, who's got the most energy? GenZ? Millennials? What does the data show?

<em>Harvard Business Review</em> dings some stereotypes:

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Despite the negative stereotypes that older workers have less energy and are less productive, the data shows otherwise. </p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>According to research from the Stanford Center on Longevity, older workers are healthy, have a strong work ethic, are loyal to their employers . . .  Moreover, a London Business School study showed that more people under 45 were exhausted (43%) than those over 45 (35%), with the least exhausted group being those over 60.</p></div>

When I was in my 20s I thought people in their 40s were old and over the hill! (What did I know?) 

I wonder why we fixate on stereotypes instead of seeing individuals. These conceptions/images certainly aren't being created by a 64-year old <a href="https://www.tonal.com/blog/introducing-tony-hortons-new-workouts-with-tonal/" target="blank">Tony Horton</a> or 60-year old <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/tom-cruise-days-off-work-1235278344/" target="blank">Tom Cruise</a>  . . . 

Nor are they created by tech boomers like Lynda Weinman, online advertising guru Leslie Laredo, or the late Steve Jobs.
