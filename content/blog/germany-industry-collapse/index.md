More daunting news from Germany. Today the head of the German Federation of Trade Unions <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-03/germany-s-union-head-warns-of-collapse-of-entire-industries" target="blank">warned</a>:

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Because of the gas bottlenecks, entire industries are in danger of permanently collapsing: aluminum, glass, the chemical industry. Such a collapse would have massive consequences for the entire economy and jobs in Germany.</p></div>

Per Bloomberg she made the comments ahead of crisis talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Fahimi added that such a crisis would come on the heels of record-high inflation and "rising costs for Co2 emissions."

She concluded: "The crisis could lead to social and labor unrest."
