Florida governor Ron DeSantis's move to <a href="[https://www.flgov.com/2022/06/15/governor-ron-desantis-unveils-the-florida-state-guard/](https://flsg.myflorida.com/)" target="blank">reestablish the Florida State Guard</a> became a national story leading to strong partisan reactions.

CNN's headline read: "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/02/politics/florida-state-guard-desantis/index.html" target="blank">DeSantis proposes a new civilian military force in Florida that he would control</a>."

The first sentence of the artice states "that he [DeSantis], not the Pentagon, would control" this "civilian military force."

Well, yes, that is how state guards work: the commander-in-chief <em>is</em> the governor. State guards operate under the military laws of the state they are based in. The Pentagon doesn't control state guards and never has. 

Reconstitution of a state guard would be a low-priority - even boring - news story, but a stream of sensationalism followed with claims that DeSantis wanted a private army that would ominously do his bidding. I admit I fell for the clickbait myself! ("He wants what?" -click- "Oh! It's just a story about reconstituting a state guard!")

Following the news, current and former elected officials took to Twitter comparing the prosposed state guard with "<a href="https://twitter.com/charliecrist/status/1466452164654608391?lang=en" target="blank">hand-picked secret police</a>" that a "<a href="https://twitter.com/annette_taddeo/status/1466459197667741700" target="blank">wannabe dictator</a>" would turn into "<a href="https://twitter.com/annette_taddeo/status/1466459197667741700" target="blank">his own vigilante militia like we've seen in Cuba.</a>" 

Since I previously served in Virgina's state guard (called the <a href="https://va.ng.mil/Va-Defense-Force/" target="blank">Virginia Defense Force</a>) I thought I'd share what it was like.

## I joined the state guard

I was invited to consider joining by a retired Lt. Col. friend of mine. I had actually never heard of the state guard before that conversation.

After seeing the photos of VDF folks wading through chest-deep water and engaged in light search-and-rescue drills, joining seemed like a fun (and adventurous) way to get involved in the community. So to learn more I attended a local meeting of Fairfax County's Alpha Company, part of the Blackhorse Brigade.

The folks there were warm and welcoming and Alpha's captain was instantly likeable, a military vet, and natural leader. I decided to join, and took the pledge.  

The state guard provides light support services to the National Guard so that it can focus on urgent priorities.

Unlike the National Guard, you can't be drafted into a war and you can quit, for any reason, at any time.

## What did you do? 

We did regular classroom training, online training, military drills, and outdoor training.

This included: 

* Extensive FEMA training, particularly in how multiple agencies interface in an emergency, including staging details. (I was impressed by how well-designed this approach is.)
* Medical/first-aid training.
* Emergency responder training for many types of disasters.

Some volunteers trained in light search-and-rescue with aircraft and boats. (The latter were part of a "riverine detachment.") Some specialized in electronic communications.

A typical Alpha Company training weekend might be doing an all-nighter in sub-zero temps and high winds to learn how to guard an armory in shifts, and communicate effectively, with no one ever abandoning their post.


## What else does the state guard do? 

The state guard is on call during disasters to provide humanitarian relief. This includes setting up (and managing) emergency shelters, providing basic first aid, and handling logistics for supplies. 

They may transport, unload, and set up cots, bedding, food and water. They may also direct traffic at chokepoints.

The Virginia Defense Force (VDF) was trained to set up mobile communications units for in-state National Guard deployments. This frees up some of the National Guard's time.

In weather emergencies, such as severe winter storms or hurricanes, state guard troops may travel <a href="https://vdf.virginia.gov/2022/01/26/vdf-provides-logistics-support-during-vng-winter-storm-response/" target="blank">hundreds of miles</a> to load and transport equipment like radio communications devices, chainsaws, state fuel cards, and food, and deliver it to National Guard staging areas.

Once activated, you have to be ready to show up within a narrow time frame with all of your gear. 

### Capabilities vary between states

The skillsets of state guards vary from state to state. 

For example: 

* The <a href="https://tmd.texas.gov/state-guard" target="blank">Texas State Guard</a> has recruited quite a number of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals -- enough to staff a medical brigade and provide free clinics to the public. 
    * Those services included "primary medical care, dental care, and even free eye examinations and glasses." In one week alone they provided "42,000 services to over 9,000 people." 
   * The medical unit does of course also provide medical clinics during emergencies - e.g., on site at hurricane shelters.
* The VDF now has cybersecurity capabilities. 
* Other state guards may have robust aviation capabilities. 

And so on.

### Supporting National Guard families

The state guard also provides support services to spouses of National Guard troops deployed overseas. 

This might be as simple as checking in to see if they need assistance with anything, such as getting a car fixed or getting something delivered. 

This is intended as a morale boost to National Guard troops and is a natural part of the military culture of loyalty.

## Did you wear a uniform?

Yes, state guard members do wear a military uniform. (A dress uniform -- for public events -- was optional.)

As a volunteer, you have to purchase your own gear, including the right kind of winter parka, belts, tees and boots. You have a list of other items to obtain, such as a sleeping bag and duffel bag, but you can use items you already own.

I learned that GI "polyprop" longjohns -- with the <a href="https://armysurpluswarehouselexington.com/product/military-issued-gen-iii-quarter-zip-polypropylene-thermal-top/" target="blank">turtleneck tops</a> -- are the best for staying warm in sub-zero conditions! (I also learned to never put them in the dryer. They actually melt into hard plastic!)

## Were you ever deployed? 

Yes, but only for minor events, such assisting with the governor's inauguration. (While I no longer live in Virginia, I see the guard was actively involved in the state's COVID-19 response.) 

There are many volunteer organizations, especially in the Beltway area, including CERT and the Red Cross.
* One the one hand, that makes it unlikely that a state guard unit would ever be in urgent demand there.
* On the other hand, that is one reason to have such a volunteer force; it's better to have more volunteers than you need, than to come up short when they're needed most.

## Was that a paid position? 

It's a volunteer position, meaning you only get paid when on active duty. The pay is in the form of a very modest daily stipend. 

The vast majority of your time is spent in training and that is unpaid.

## Pros? Cons?

Some pros:

* I met very interesting people and enjoyed most of the activities. It was an adventure.
* Everyone had a can-do attitude, was welcoming, and wanted to make a difference in the community
* I learned a lot, including from military veterans.

You'll come away with a better understanding (and appreciation) of how local, state, regional, and federal entities work together in an emergency to protect citizens. And any member of the community can participate in this process.

A few quibbles:

* Military jargon and acronyms made understanding even basic documents difficult. 
* We were supposed to receive military ID cards but somehow the "system" (not our local company) could not figure out how to get this done -- ever. I wondered what would be the impact of showing up, in uniform, without state guard ID cards at a joint staging area in an emergency?
* We got called on for traffic control; something I didn't particularly care for. (In crowded circumstances, members of the public are not always amenable to "stop" or "wait" directions.)

### Would you change anything?

I question whether military uniforms are necessary or ideal for the state guard. The <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA494465.pdf" target="blank">view of the military however</a> is that State Defense Forces (SDFs), operating "under the protocol of military guidance and customs . . . are less likely to walk away from assigned missions and are more likely to integrate well with the National Guard units that are given those missions." And it's true that the state guard is the "reserve" for the National Guard.

   <summary>My idea on uniforms . . . </summary></br>
   <p>In an emergency, uniforms make it easy for the public to see whose available to help.</p>
<p>But why not make it simple: like same color shirt, windbreaker, maybe a baseball cap? (If windbreakers and caps are good enough for the FBI they should be good enough for the state guard.)</p>

<p>You could do this <em>and</em> while allowing military veterans to wear military uniforms in the state guard: making them easy to spot, when needed, in a group.</p>

## In sum

I'm glad I joined the Virgina Defense Force and really enjoyed my time there. We had an interesting mix of people in our company from all types of backgrounds. Some worked for the State Department or Department of Defense. Others were logistics professionals or young adults looking for experience before joining the U.S. Army, Navy or Air Force. We had former military members as well as folks simply interested in helping out. And we had good foreign language capability -- including professional translators -- in our unit. 

If you're curious about joining a state guard I encourage you to attend a meeting of your local company. Simply go to your state guard's website and to get information on where and when they are meeting. Members of the public who are interested in joining can freely sit in.

And I hope this short recollection provides a bit of context for the curious onlooker concerned about the hysteria over the reconsitution of the Florida state guard.
