<em>Reason</em> magazine has an <a href="https://reason.com/2022/10/26/to-protect-privileged-shippers-from-competition-the-government-fought-jones-act-waivers/" target=blank">interesting article</a> out on government actions to prevent Jones Act waivers. The article cites the Cato Institute which obtained <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/foia-files-marads-efforts-stop-jones-act-waiver-lng" target="blank">internal government emails</a> that highlight the role cronyism plays in driving up natural gas prices.
  
As I mentioned in <a href="https://sherrieg.com/electricity-inflation-new-england/" target="blank">this blog post</a> about the local New Hampshire electricity hike of 112%:

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Because of the archaic Jones Act, we can’t ship U.S.-produced LNG (liquified natural gas) from American ports to our terminals.</p></div> 

This <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/new-england-is-an-energy-crisis-waiting" target="blank">Doomberg substack article</a> has a good summary of the problem: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>A key stipulation of the law is that foreign-owned ships cannot transport goods between two US ports – only ships built, owned, and crewed by Americans are permitted to do so. While the US has become the largest producer of natural gas and an ever-larger exporter of LNG, the country does not produce LNG carriers. Since <strong>there are no US LNG carriers</strong>, <em>New England cannot benefit from the build-out of LNG export facilities along the Gulf of Mexico, despite having significant LNG import facilities like the one in Everett, Massachusetts</em>.</p></div> 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>That means<strong> New England is in the same bidding pool as Europe and Asia</strong>. Amazingly . . . Instead of simply building pipelines to its land neighbors, New England pays for boats to sail more than 2,000 miles – burning fossil fuels and polluting the oceans as they do so – and pays a substantially higher price for the privilege. Bonkers!</p></div>
