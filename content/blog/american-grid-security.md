Cotter</a> on the vulnerability of the U.S. grid is well worth combing through. 

The takeway: Russia has been inside the U.S. Bulk Power System (BPS) for over a decade, and the nature of the incursions are deliberately hidden by the U.S. government from the public.

* Russia's ". . . Cyberwarfare tools, training, reconnaissance, and testing puts Russia in control of the Grid as a battlespace . . ."
* "the nation [U.S.] is past the tipping point . . ."
* "CIP standards have no value in protecting the Grid from foreign adversaries . . ." Instead, they're a "'feel good' placebo for regulators and other overseers."
