It's ironic that, against the background of the swampadelic FTX meltdown, the Pentagon failed to pass an independent audit -- <a href="https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2022-11-16/pentagon-financial-audit-8075353.html" target="blank">for the 5th year in a row<a>. Just a <a href="https://news.antiwar.com/2022/11/16/pentagon-fails-fifth-consecutive-audit-amid-ukraine-oversight-concerns/" target="blank">few trillion</a> at stake. 

Like SBF, the Pentagon assures us that it's just a <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2022/11/16/dod-fails-audit-cites-ukraine-as-teachable-moment-in-accountability/" target="blank">"teachable moment"</a>.  
  
It could've been worse I suppose. The Pentagon and FTX could've done a merger + reband ("PentaFTX: Better Together"?), with SBF sponsoring operations via a giant neon sign perched on the roof of the defense building.
