I used 12s on the top for the ES-175 jazzbox, and 10s on the top for solid-bodies.
After getting the Strat and getting some custom work done on it (had the neck shaved down to a #1 at the suggestion of my luthier) I started using 9s on the top. 
* Brand: I've used <a href="https://www.drstrings.com/" target="blank">DRs</a> ever since they came out. Usually use Hi-Beams.
* Frets: Skinny please, not jumbo
* Necks: prefer Les Paul or PRS dimensions, minimal (oiled) finish, not heavy lacquer
