Last night I read the news about the assasination of Daria Dugin (also spelled Darya Dugina) - the daughter of Russian activist and far-right ideologue Alexander Dugin. 

This was a horrifying tableau; I can't imagine what it must have been like for the father to be at the scene of his daughter's murder. 

After I read several versions of this story, two ironies came to mind.

Predictably, many Western media outlets are leading with the notion that Darya's father is "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/daughter-of-putins-brain-ideologist-killed-in-car-blast/2022/08/21/ded9acc0-2124-11ed-9ce6-68253bd31864_story.html" target="blank">Putin's Brain</a>," Putin's "Rasputin," or even "<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19571946/putins-guide-alexander-hospital-bomb-killed-daughter/" target="blank">Putin's War Mastermind</a>." 

The idea is that Alexander Dugin's ideas heavily influence and therefore explain Putin's actions. The problem is this claim is highly speculative and tenuous at best. It seems pushed primarily by the American press, although it has some roots in foreign reportage.

Many of Dugin's views are eclectic and shared by other streams of thought in Russian history and politics. Some of them have been around for decades and even centuries.

Besides, Putin's current ideas and actions can easily be inferred from 20+ years of his public speaking and writing. There's no need to go digging up relatively obscure mystic-totalists. But I suppose it is great for "clicks" and people who want an entertaining take on international news. 

As a result of being dubbed "Putin's Brain," Dugin received Western media interview requests and public speaking opportunities, which he was gladly accepted. To my knowledge he never claimed the title of "Putin's Brain," instead he used each news media query as a pivot point to discuss his views. 

Ironically, the repeated elevation of Dugin by the American press may have significantly expanded his influence both abroad and possibly in his own country. One has to wonder whether this was perceived by Putin as a problem.

The other irony is in Dugin's comments regarding Russian victims of the war in Ukraine. In an interview earlier this year, <a href="https://www.memri.org/reports/purported-putin-whisperer-dugin-solar-putin-must-mobilize-entire-russian-people-win-struggle" target="blank">translated by Memri.org</a>, Dugin seems to dismiss Russian civilian casualties as "certain technological problems" with "the reunion" - i.e., just a technical glitch.

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: But besides Zelensky, there are 40 million people residing in Ukraine. The special operation that is underway now, is being conducted in the Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine. Russians live here, the Russian language is spoken here. Kharkov, Mariupol...</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;">How do you explain to a Russian mother, who lost her home, her child, who witnessed all the horrors of destruction and bombing, that all this was done for her own good? Not on a metaphysical plane, but on a material one, what is she suffering for?</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p><strong>Dugin</strong>: There are people, who think and seek to comprehend the truth, and there are people, who deal with certain technological problems regarding the reunion. </p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Back in 2014 it was clear what should be told to her. The streets of Kharkiv in 2014 were covered with flyers containing my statements and quotes, my portraits were plastered on the premises of the city administration.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: True, and Russian volunteers were coming to Donbass carrying your ideas about the Russian world. However, today is 2022. The homes of Russian-speaking Ukrainians were destroyed not eight years ago, but are being destroyed now.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p><strong>Dugin</strong>: There is such an Old Testament prophet named Jeremiah. He is known for his lamentation. So, I can announce that the state of my soul from 2014 to 2022 is Jeremiah's lament for the Russian World. I was heartbroken about what we had to do.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Naturally, we are in a difficult situation now, and many opportunities for soft solutions have been lost. I don't know who is to blame, just as I don't know who is to blame for the fall of Troy...</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So, how do you explain to a Russian mother from Mariupol that all the unfolding events are for the good?</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p><strong>Dugin</strong>: A death of loved ones is a horrible grief. Now it’s almost impossible to explain many things. We will explain it all later, after the liberation of Ukraine. When Mariupol will be ours, then your question will become relevant. Right now, our plan is to win.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>As soon as the flags of Eastern Ukraine, of Russia, of freedom and independence soars over Kherson and Novorossiya; as soon as Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts will be liberated, [as soon as] Kherson, Nikolayev, Zaporozhe, Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk and other republics will be established, we’ll immediately start to explain.</p></div><br/>
