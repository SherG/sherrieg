Last night I read the news about the assasination of Darya Dugin - the daughter of Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin. 

There are two ironies that stand out in this story.

Predictably, many Western media outlets are leading with the notion that Darya's father is "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/daughter-of-putins-brain-ideologist-killed-in-car-blast/2022/08/21/ded9acc0-2124-11ed-9ce6-68253bd31864_story.html" target="blank">Putin's Brain</a>," Putin's "Rasputin," or even "<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19571946/putins-guide-alexander-hospital-bomb-killed-daughter/" target="blank">Putin's War Mastermind</a>." 

Here are some examples: 

* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du7fOoW_euE" target="blank">Aleksandr Dugin: The far-right theorist behind Putin's plan</a> - 60 Minutes
Leslie Stahl's producer at 60 Minutes said: "Alexander Dugin is a Russian political philosopher who's been called 'The Putin Whisperer.' He's got Vladimir Putin's ear and he's really influential in shaping Russian policy at the highest level." The program featured interview clips that were filmed with Dugin in 2017. 


The idea is that Alexander Dugin's ideas heavily influence and therefore explain Putin's actions. 

This notion seems largely speculative though. 

The AP put some distance between themselves and the term "Putin's Brain (even though it's in their <a href="

The irony is the reason he's referred to as "Putin's brain" seems to be because western journalists led with that narrative early in the war, and it spread, largely uncritically. And that attention paid to him seems likely to have boosted his influence not only abroad but also in Russia.
