Last night I read the news about the assasination of Daria Dugin (also spelled Darya Dugina) - the daughter of Russian activist and ideologue Alexander Dugin. 

There are two ironies that stand out in this story.

Predictably, many Western media outlets are leading with the notion that Darya's father is "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/daughter-of-putins-brain-ideologist-killed-in-car-blast/2022/08/21/ded9acc0-2124-11ed-9ce6-68253bd31864_story.html" target="blank">Putin's Brain</a>," Putin's "Rasputin," or even "<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19571946/putins-guide-alexander-hospital-bomb-killed-daughter/" target="blank">Putin's War Mastermind</a>." 

The idea is that Alexander Dugin's ideas heavily influence and therefore explain Putin's actions. The problem is this claim seems highly speculative and tenuous at best -- and concocted primarily by the American press. 

While <em>Foreign Policy</em> featured a story in 2014 that called Dugin "Putin's Brain," the appellation seems to have really taken off since the invasion of Ukraine. 

For example, 60 Minutes aired this in April 2022: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du7fOoW_euE" target="blank">Aleksandr Dugin: The far-right theorist behind Putin's plan</a>. Leslie Stahl's producer at 60 Minutes said: "Alexander Dugin is a Russian political philosopher who's been called 'The Putin Whisperer.' He's got Vladimir Putin's ear and he's really influential in shaping Russian policy at the highest level." The 2022 program featured interview clips that were filmed with Dugin in 2017. 

Many of Dugin's views are eclectic and shared by other streams of thought in Russian history and politics. Some of them have been around for decades and even centuries.

Ironically, the repeated elevation of Dugin by the American press has likely significantly expanded his influence both abroad and possibly in his own country.

Cyril Aslanov 
described him as having "an absolutely demented ideology" and that calling him a "philosopher" 

 He's a type that has a completely megolomaniacal conception, that far exceeds Putin's ambitions. This is a very important point." he allows that some think he influences Putin, and that Putin uses him a bit bit there is a huge difference between Putin and Dugin -- namely that Dugin wants a "colossal, nightmarish revolution."

apologist for violence and genocide 


Commenting on the assasination, Cyril Aslanov quipped that it was a real "fluke of destiny" that "this political activist, agitator . . . had succeeded in obtaining an audience. In fact a guy like that, you'd normally hear, perched on a barrel in Hyde Park.. . In fact, Putin has used this sinister braggart . . .but in my opinion,
