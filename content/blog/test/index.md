Last night I read the news about the assasination of Darya Dugin - the daughter of Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin. 

There are two ironies that stand out in this story.

Predictably, many Western media outlets are leading with the notion that Darya's father is "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/daughter-of-putins-brain-ideologist-killed-in-car-blast/2022/08/21/ded9acc0-2124-11ed-9ce6-68253bd31864_story.html" target="blank">Putin's Brain</a>" or Putin's "Rasputin." 

He's alleged to have influence over Putin and has even been described as "<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19571946/putins-guide-alexander-hospital-bomb-killed-daughter/" target="blank">Putin's War Mastermind</a>." 

This notion seems largely speculative though. 

The AP put some distance between themselves and the term "Putin's Brain (even though it's in their <a href="

The irony is the reason he's referred to as "Putin's brain" seems to be because western journalists led with that narrative early in the war, and it spread, largely uncritically. And that attention paid to him seems likely to have boosted his influence not only abroad but also in Russia.
