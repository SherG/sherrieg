This is a nutrient-dense dish that's mildly spicy. Easy to make, it's a meal in itself and pairs well with grilled chicken. (Add some fire to that chicken with Weber's Kick'n Chicken seasoning.) Plus you can serve it up as a burrito.

Tips:

* Experiment to taste with the amount of vinegar and lime juice. 
* I like the adobo sauce that comes in Goya's canned chipotle peppers. Adding the thick sauce from 1-2 cans really adds a lot of flavor. 
* Add fresh corn if you like or red and yellow peppers

Cook the beans first, then chill a bit before adding the vegetables, spices and liquids. 

## Ingredients 

* 1 lb. dry black beans
* 1 pouch of microwaveable wild rice 
* 1 red onion, chopped
* 1 orange bell pepper, chopped 
* Some tomatoes: fresh, or 1 can of Muir Glen fire-roasted tomatoes, or a container of fresh salsa from your produce section
* Adobo sauce to taste
* 1/4 cup or more of vinegar, juice from 1-2 limes, a bit of olive oil 
* 1 jalape√±o or serrano pepper, chopped (I prefer serranos - they're hotter)

## Spices (suit to taste)
* Chili pepper
* Ground cumin
* Cayenne pepper

## Optional garnishes: 
* Low-fat sour cream, chopped cilantro
* Toss in some Beer Nuts (trust me on that one!)

## Cook the beans

* Rinse the beans and place in pot. 
* Cover with water (about 8 cups). 
* Add a bay leaf.
* Bring to a roiling broil. Then simmer, covered for around 40-45 minutes. 

Note: I like firm beans. You may need to cook them longer to suit your preference. 

Drain and cool the beans in the fridge for a bit. This helps prevent the onions and bell pepper from getting mushy when you add them.

## Add the rest 

Then toss in the vegetables and other ingredients. Season to suit your taste. 



Enjoy!
