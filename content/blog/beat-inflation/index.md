Years ago I came across an interesting inflation-beating tip called "The Poor Man's Strategy." The name is based on the fact that anyone can do this.

## Buying ahead

The idea is to buy non-perishables now that you know for sure you'll need in the future. Of course, you'll stay within your budget to do this.

Here are a few examples: 
* Hiking boots
* Notebook paper and pens
* Batteries

Once you put your mind to it, all sorts of things will come to mind. You could categorize these by use (e.g., automotive) and/or by cost.

### Sorting + prioritizing 

One popular idea is to create cost tiers, and to work on one exclusively before moving to another. For example: 
* Tier 1: low-to-moderate cost items
* Tier 2: pricier items (e.g., automobile tires)

Tier 2 is likely where most people will spend their money. Here are some examples to get your creative thinking going: 

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky"><strong>Car</strong></th>
    <th class="tg-0pky"><strong>Personal care</strong></th>
    <th class="tg-0pky"><strong>Clothing</strong></th>
    <th class="tg-0pky"><strong>Household</strong></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">bulbs</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">soap, shampoo</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">shoes</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">laundry detergent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">fluids + lubricants</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">razor blades</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">socks</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">cleaning fluids</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">windshield wipers</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">toothpaste</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">underwear</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">trash bags</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">cabin air filter</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">saline solution</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">tees</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">light bulbs</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">battery</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">make-up</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">jeans</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">fix-it items: duct tape, glue, <br>nails, caulking, etc</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br/>It's kind of a fun exercise. Once you list your "must-have" non-perishables, you can sort the items by priority.

Buying ahead can be as simple as: you need trash bags, found a great sale price, and buy 2-3 instead of 1.

Also: think about getting some silica gel tins to keep tools and other stored items free of moisture.

I hope this is helpful!
