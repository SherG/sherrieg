Years ago I came across an interesting inflation-beating tip called "The Poor Man's Strategy." The name is based on the fact that anyone can do this.

The idea is to stock up on non-perishables that you know for sure you'll need in the future. Of course, you'll stay within your budget to do this.

Here are a few examples: 
* Hiking boots
* Notebook paper and pens
* Batteries
* Trash bags
* Tools you don't have, that you think you'll need

Once you start thinking of ideas all sorts of things will come to mind. You could categorize these by use (e.g., automotive) and/or by cost. 

One popular idea is to create 3 cost tiers, and to work on one exclusively before moving to another: 
* Tier 1: free things you can do
* Tier 2: low-to-moderate cost items
* Tier 3: pricey items 

An example of Tier 1 might be: you have the materials to build an extra firewood shed. Because you want to buy extra firewood soon (Tier 3) you go ahead and build the shed, expending only your time. 

Tier 2 is likely where most people will spend their money. Here are some examples to get your creative thinking going: 

| Car               | Personal care   | Clothing  | Household                                           |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| bulbs             | soap, shampoo   | shoes     | laundry detergent                                   |
| oil + lubricants  | razor blades    | socks     | dishwashing soap                                    |
| windshield wipers | toothpaste      | underwear | bleach                                              |
| cabin filter      | saline solution | tees      | light bulbs                                         |
| tires             | make-up         | jeans     | fix-it items: duct tape, glue, nails, caulking, etc |


<br/>It's kind of a fun exercise. Once you figure out what your non-perishables are, you can prioritize them. 

Also: think about getting some silica gel tins to keep tools and metal items free of moisture.

I hope this is helpful!
