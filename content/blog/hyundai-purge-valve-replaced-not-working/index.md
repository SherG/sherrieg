After months, my Hyundai evap system problem has finally been fixed. Thanks to the internet, I wound up diagnosing the recurring issue after two garages couldn't.

Just in case there's another person puzzling over this same issue, here's my story & what I learned. 

<strong>TL;DR</strong>: If you need to replace a purge valve on a Hyundai, tell your mechanic he must use a genuine Hyundia valve. Otherwise, the electrical resistance will be incorrect, the check engine light will come back on, and the problem will return.

Background: I wound up having a series of 440-range error codes, which ultimately combined with a 300-302 error code.

Garage #1 originally diagnosed the PO440-ish (I forget the actual number) error code as an air bag problem, even though I brought the car in because, upon fill-up, it stalled. 

This 'diagnosis' led to a humorous conversation where the young mechanic informed me that he had a $10,000 computer so his diagnosis had to be right. To which I admitted that I only had a $23 car computer from Amazon, but wondered how an airbag problem could cause a stall upon fillup. Also the code itself indicated an evap system problem.

I suggested maybe a valve needed to be replaced. He eventually decided the purge valve was the issue and replaced it. That worked on the first fill-up, but the problem immediately returned, along with the check engine light.

Returned to Garage #1. They said they didn't know what the problem was. I suggested new spark plugs + a gas cap. Couldn't hurt, and it'd been a while since the plugs were replaced. This did not work either. 

* Garage #2: Mechanic informed me that the CVV valve needed to be replaced. Ten miles from garage, on return home, check engine light returned + problem appeared upon fill up. I got a <a href="https://repairpal.com/obd-ii-code-p0446" target="blank">PO446 error code</a>. (Evap control circuit issue.)

Returned to mechanic: after an hour, he returned to tell me he'd figured out I need a new (wait for it) purge valve and had installed it. Then he explained in detail how he arrived at his conclusion. And he'd done extensive electrical tests via computer and found no other problem.

I informed him that this part had already been replaced by Garage #1. He suggested I drive the car anyway and see if the problem was fixed. In under 15 miles, check engine light came on again + problem returned. 

I wasn't willing to keep throwing money at this situation, so I dove deeper into the internet. Among the many possibilities, I found a gem in an online forum that rang true. A guy said he'd replaced his purge valve twice and the problem recurred. Then he tested it with a multimeter and found the electrical resistance of the valve was 20 ohms and it was non-OEM. After replacing it with a genuine Hyundai purge valve, resistance was 30 ohms and everything worked perfectly. 

I bought a genuine Hyundai purge valve from Amazon for less that $25 and asked Garage #2 to intall it. Fixed it perfectly. (The mechanic did not charge me for replacing the second or third purge valve.)

<strong>Moral of the story: The incorrect resistance of a non-Hyundai purge valve will trigger an evap control circuit error. So if your mechanic is installing a purge valve, make sure it's OEM.</strong>

The recent heat wave (which reached a real feel 105°F -- 40.6°C
-- last week) fried my battery & alternator. Replaced both. Car is working fine. But there's a minor issue that has piqued my curiosity, so I'm searching car forums again . . .
