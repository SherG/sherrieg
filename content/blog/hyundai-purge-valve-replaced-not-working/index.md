After months, my Hyundai evap system problem has finally been fixed. Thanks to the internet, I wound up diagnosing the recurring issue after two garages couldn't.

Just in case there's another person puzzling over this same issue, here's what I learned:

* If you need to replace a purge valve on a Hyundai, tell your mechanic he must use a genuine Hyundai valve. 
* If he uses a non-OEM valve, the electrical resistance will be incorrect (20 Ω vs. 30 Ω with the genuine part), the check engine light will come back on, and the problem will return.
