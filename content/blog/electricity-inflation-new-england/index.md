Our local electricity provider Eversource has received an approval for a 112% increase in energy supply costs charged to consumers. This was first reported by media in June, which warned of "<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-increases-electricity-bills-61622/40314355" target="blank">drastic increases</a>" in bills.

Increased costs of natural gas were a main factor cited.

New England seems to suffer from poor (and short-sighted) energy design it seems. The Doomberg Substack has a good summary of this issue <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/new-england-is-an-energy-crisis-waiting" target="blank">here</a>. 

Some snapshots from the Substack and the <em>Boston Globe</em>:

* We're adjacent to one of the most natural gas-rich regions (the Appalachian Basin) but for lack of gas pipelines can't get adequate amounts delivered here. 
* Because of the archaic Jones Act, we can't ship U.S.-produced LNG (liquified natural gas) from American ports to New England.
* As a result we're dependent on shipping in LNG from foreign countries which, of course, burns more fossil fuels 
* Boston Harbor's Everett Marine Terminal imported 60% of its LNG in 2020. Historically it's sourced LNG from countries including Norway, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and "rarely" from Russia. Massachussetts relies on natgas for two-thirds of its electricity needs. 
* Activists have <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/11/03/science/maine-voters-reject-transmission-line-that-would-bring-clean-energy-mass/" target="blank">scuttled</a> renewable energy plans for electricity transmission lines carrying <em>hydro</em> power.

Why the Jones Act has not already been nixed is puzzling. Here's a passage from the <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/new-england-is-an-energy-crisis-waiting" target="blank">Doomberg Substack</a> that highlights the problems:

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>A key stipulation of the law is that foreign-owned ships cannot transport goods between two US ports – only ships built, owned, and crewed by Americans are permitted to do so. While the US has become the largest producer of natural gas and an ever-larger exporter of LNG, the country does not produce LNG carriers. Since <strong>there are no US LNG carriers</strong>, New England cannot benefit from the build-out of LNG export facilities along the Gulf of Mexico, despite having significant LNG import facilities like the one in Everett, Massachusetts.</p></div> 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>That means<strong> New England is in the same bidding pool as Europe and Asia</strong>. Amazingly, most LNG imports to the Everett terminal have come from Trinidad and Tobago! Instead of simply building pipelines to its land neighbors, New England pays for boats to sail more than 2,000 miles – burning fossil fuels and polluting the oceans as they do so – and pays a substantially higher price for the privilege. Bonkers!</p></div> 

So while other countries are ordering new LNG carriers - some with the impressive Mark III tank technology by <a href="https://gtt.fr/technologies/markiii-systems" target="blank">France's GTT</a> - America has exactly zero carriers. (Interestingly, the Mark III technology can also be applied to ships using <a href="https://gtt.fr/applications/lng-as-a-fuel" target="blank">LNG as marine fuel</a>.)
