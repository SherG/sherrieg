Our local electricity provider Eversource has received an approval for a 112% increase in energy supply costs charged to consumers. This was first reported by media in June, which warned of "<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-increases-electricity-bills-61622/40314355" target="blank">drastic increases</a>" in bills.

Increased costs of natural gas were a main factor cited.

New England seems to suffer from poor (and short-sighted) energy design. 

Some snapshots:

* We're adjacent to one of the most natural gas-rich regions (the Appalachian Basin) but for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-22/new-england-power-plants-burn-most-oil-since-2011-as-gas-soars?sref=9Bl7eBfE" target="blank">lack of pipelines/capacity</a> we can't get adequate amounts delivered here. So we import LNG (see below) and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-22/new-england-power-plants-burn-most-oil-since-2011-as-gas-soars" target="blank">burn "dirtier" oil</a> as winter temperatures plunge. This increases emissions.
* Because of the archaic Jones Act, we can't ship U.S.-produced LNG (liquified natural gas) from American ports to New England.
* As a result we're dependent on importing LNG from foreign countries -- a process which burns more fossil fuels.
* Boston Harbor's Everett Marine Terminal imported 60% of its LNG in 2020. Historically it's sourced LNG from Norway, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Russia. (Massachussetts relies on natgas for two-thirds of its electricity needs.)
* Maine voters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/maine-voters-reject-quebec-hydropower-transmission-line-2021-11-03/" target="blank">scuttled</a> renewable energy plans for electricity transmission lines carrying <em>hydro</em> power into New England from Quebec. (A similar proposal was previously rejected by New Hampshire voters.)

Why the Jones Act has not already been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-17/don-t-waive-the-jones-act-scrap-it" target="blank">nixed</a> is puzzling. Here's a passage from the <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/new-england-is-an-energy-crisis-waiting" target="blank">Doomberg Substack</a> that highlights the problems:

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>A key stipulation of the law is that foreign-owned ships cannot transport goods between two US ports – only ships built, owned, and crewed by Americans are permitted to do so. While the US has become the largest producer of natural gas and an ever-larger exporter of LNG, the country does not produce LNG carriers. Since <strong>there are no US LNG carriers</strong>, New England cannot benefit from the build-out of LNG export facilities along the Gulf of Mexico, despite having significant LNG import facilities like the one in Everett, Massachusetts.</p></div> 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>That means<strong> New England is in the same bidding pool as Europe and Asia</strong>. Amazingly, most LNG imports to the Everett terminal have come from Trinidad and Tobago! Instead of simply building pipelines to its land neighbors, New England pays for boats to sail more than 2,000 miles – burning fossil fuels and polluting the oceans as they do so – and pays a substantially higher price for the privilege. Bonkers!</p></div> 

Time to stock up on firewood + seal those cracks.
