It's been a busy winter here in New Hampshire, but I thought I'd pop in for a short update.

* The recent arctic weather brought wind chills down to -49 here. Thanks to a roaring fire, I was toasty inside and enjoying the  whole adventure. Car took around 30 minutes to warm up the next day. Seemed lke the steering fluid had frozen. In a bonkers move, Canadian geese returned the day before. 
* Maybe it's not the deep state, but the <a href="https://topsecretumbra.substack.com/p/the-fecklessness-is-the-point" target="blank">DERP state</a>.
* Had the opportunity to try Erbology's <a href="https://erbology.co/us/shop/organic-sea-buckthorn-shots/" target="blank">sea buckthorn shots</a>. Citrusy tang, followed by a veggie-like flavor and slight chalky aftertaste. Major energy/alertness boost. (Added it to fruit juice since it's a bit strong to drink straight.)
* Enjoying <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/" target="blank">Gary Marcus's substack</a>: a "no-bullshit look at AI progress and hype." Looking forward to reading his book <em>Rebooting AI</em>.
