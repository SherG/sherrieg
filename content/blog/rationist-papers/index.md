On June 3rd, in <a href="/what-comes-after-democracy/" target="blank">my post on anacyclosis</a>, I mentioned the interesting work of Rationist.org. The related "Rationist Papers" are now being published sequentially on The Blind Spot. 

You can <a href="https://the-blindspot.com/the-anacyclosis-blind-spot/" target="blank">read the first one here</a>.

Also see Izabella Kaminska's overview: "<a href="https://the-blindspot.com/how-about-a-vitruvian-capitalist-reset/" target="blank">How about a Vitruvian capitalist reset?</a>"

Kaminska is the founder of The Blind Spot. She's a veteran of the <em>Financial</em> Times, Platts, and several other markets- and commodities-focused publications. 

* Timothy Ferguson is author of the Rationist Papers and the founder of the Anacyclosis Institute.
* Kaminska is a board member at the Anacyclosis Institute. 

I'm working my way through the papers now. Hopefully publication on The Blind Spot will stir debate.
