Have you ever worked under an NDA? Many people in the digital space do.

When completing a service agreement bound by an NDA, I think you're well-served by signing a "bookend" agreement with your next employer.

By "bookend" agreement I mean a contract, signed by the new employer, that binds them to not inquire about proprietary methods, proprietary software, special processes, etc., regarding your previous employers or clients. 

I think this is a great idea because you don't want to be probed for secrets. In fact, I think it's a good idea even if you aren't bound by an NDA.

* If you're a person of integrity then you won't want to work for an employer or client that would try to pry secrets out of you. 
* And an employer of integrity won't want to hire a betrayer. 

Such a "bookend" agreement is therefore also a type of proof of intention and integrity of and for both parties.
