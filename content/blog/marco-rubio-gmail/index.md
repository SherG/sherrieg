Is Google intentionally sabotaging Republican political email campaigns? That accusation was raised at the end of May by Sen. Marco Rubio.

On May 21 Rubio tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marco Rubio for Senate is in <a href="https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Google</a> purgatory<br><br>Since a Pelosi puppet announced she was running against me they have sent 66% of my emails to REGISTERED SUPPORTERS with <a href="https://twitter.com/gmail?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gmail</a> to spam<br><br>And during the final weeks of finance quarters it climbs to over 90%</p>&mdash; Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1528015121573941251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I'm writing an in-depth article about this for my SignalFox.org site. But I'll cut to the chase here.

* There are always 3 groups involved in email marketing: the marketers, the end user, and the third parties in between. Those third-parties include email providers, email marketing platforms, add-on spam filters, and countless apps that help you sort and filter your emails. <em>The actions of all of these impact whether or not an email is marked as "spam."</em>
* The authors of a study that Republican senators cited as proving Gmail bias, have said their findings are being misinterpreted.
* Political campaign marketers are known to engage in <a href="http://ahoy-assets.twilio.com/docs/Twilio_2019_Presidential_Campaign_Email_Study.pdf?_ga=2.88913947.1452877676.1655763021-1551870462.1654233161" target="blank">poor email marketing practices</a>: the very practices that cause email to be marked as spam. 
* In the business world, a professional marketing team, when faced with spam problems, will say "Let's put our Sherlock Holmes hats on and figure out what we're doing wrong." Why don't political campaign teams do the same?
* While no observer knows the details of the Rubio team's email marketing program, it's reasonable to view claims of sabotage by Google with skepticism and to avoid amplifying them. Given the propensity of political campaigns to handle email poorly, and given the complexity of email marketing, it's incumbent on the Rubio team to prove they haven't caused their own failures.
