Is Google intentionally sabotaging Republican political email campaigns? That accusation was raised at the end of May by Sen. Marco Rubio.

On May 21 Rubio tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marco Rubio for Senate is in <a href="https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Google</a> purgatory<br><br>Since a Pelosi puppet announced she was running against me they have sent 66% of my emails to REGISTERED SUPPORTERS with <a href="https://twitter.com/gmail?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gmail</a> to spam<br><br>And during the final weeks of finance quarters it climbs to over 90%</p>&mdash; Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1528015121573941251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I'm writing an in-depth article about this for my SignalFox.org site. But I'll cut to the chase here.

* There are always 3 groups involved in email marketing: the marketers, the end user, and the third parties in between. Those third-parties include email providers, email marketing platforms, add-on spam filters, and countless apps that help you sort and filter your emails. <em>Any of these can impact whether or not an email is marked as "spam."</em>
* The authors of a study that Republican senators cited as proving Gmail bias, have said their findings are being misinterpreted.
* Political campaign marketers are known to engage in <a href="http://ahoy-assets.twilio.com/docs/Twilio_2019_Presidential_Campaign_Email_Study.pdf?_ga=2.88913947.1452877676.1655763021-1551870462.1654233161" target="blank">poor email marketing practices</a>: the very practices that cause email to be marked as spam. 
* Professional marketing teams, when faced with spam problems, will say "Let's put our Sherlock Holmes hats on and figure out what we're doing wrong." 
* While no observer knows the details of the Rubio team's email marketing practices, it's reasonable to view claims of sabotage by Google with skepticism and to avoid amplifying them. 

Spam problems call for objective diagnostics and testing rather than speculation.

This interesting study by Twilio/SendGrid used Gmail accounts to analyze the email campaigns of 2020 Democratic candidates for U.S. President. 

Only 3.8% of emails wound up in the inbox and 21% went to spam, harming their fundraising efforts. About half failed to use proper email authentication. 

The answer? Use better practices.
