Late yesterday, my firewood was delivered. Good weather means I can split my firewood stacking up over a few days. 

This is the season where we 'Yanks' get ready for winter. And I really enjoy these seasonal markers.

## Winter preps

Besides laying in firewood, another marker is getting your snow tires on. Mine were due for replacement, so I ordered new ones -- Firestone's studabble Winterforce 2s -- which have already been delivered. They'll be installed on Halloween. 

* My first pair of snows were studded Winterforce 1s (no longer made). These were amazing tires. I could zip up and down snowy mountains with no problem. 
* Then I tried out studded Nokian Hakkapeliitta 8s. Biggest difference was the Nokians are much quieter on asphalt due to the way their studs are designed and cushioned. 

My local shop told me there were shortages of Nokian tires in my size due to supply chain issues. So after doing some research online, I decided to switch back to Firestone.

I ordered the new Firestones from tires-easy.com (via Amazon), got free shipping and the best deal. (I had previously ordered the Nokians direct from tires-easy.com and can say they have amazing service).

My other 'rite' for winter is doing some basic checks on my vehicle, like radiator fluid, brake fluid, cleaning the battery terminals and placing oil-based battery terminal protectors at the base, and installing new windshield wipers. (Tip: I got my wipers from Amazon for 50% less than the in-store price.)

I've already laid in a few bottles of "dry gas" (Heet). Next: picking up sub-zero (-20) rated windshield wiper fluid.

And then I'll run down a checklist for winter items to keep in the back of the car, for emergencies. 

## Fall colors + thankfulness

The fall colors have been spectacular in New Hampshire: fiery reds, bright oranges. Breezy days have yellow leaves falling like snowflakes.

Next up, for pure fun: buying a pumpkin and turning it into a jack o'lantern. And maybe trying out a new squash soup recipe.

With the Thanksgiving holiday coming up, I have so many things to be grateful for. This will really be a special Thanksgiving.

Like you, I'm also thinking of those less fortunate. Significant spikes in heating bills will be hitting the elderly hard, for example. Here in New Hampshire we have a program called "Neighbor Helping Neighbor" where you can contribute to others' energy bills. (You can even do this when paying your electric bill.) 

Temperatures can get as low as -19F (-28C) in winter here, so coats and winter clothing are in demand too. There are coat drives currently set up at some grocery stores. There are some individuals who endure homelessness in the state during winter. They manage somehow to live in their freezing vehicles.

I hope you're enjoying the seasonal changes in your neck of the woods, that you are secure and thriving, and that your community is able to meet the winter needs of all its members.
