In the wake of the dramatic collapse of the Sri Lankan government, this post <a href="http://charleshughsmith.blogspot.com/2022/07/why-nations-fail.html" target="blank">Why Nations Fail</a> by Charles Hugh Smith caught my eye.  

He compares dissent to an evolutionary process necesssary for surfacing the best solutions. Squash the dissent (either formally or through social networks) and you lose the chance to avoid failure. And yet, corrupt regimes always choose to suppress dissent. 

Because they've hamstrung the capacity to "adapt and evolve" their nation becomes more brittle and prone to failure.

* "In eras of rapid environmental change, organisms can undergo an explosion of genetic experimentation that leads to new adaptations. "
* "We can understand variability as competition: mutations compete with the existing system's coding and the most successful variants spread because they outcompeted existing processes."
* "In human political systems, this constant flow of competing variability is dissent and the competition of ideas. Ironically, the first response of human leaders in centralized hierarchies (monarchies, totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, theocracies, plutocracies, kleptocracies, etc.) when their nation comes under pressure is to further consolidate power into the hands of the few and immediately suppress dissent of any kind as a threat to the regime's power and control."
* "The irony is that the <strong>suppression of dissent is the suppression of competing ideas</strong> that generate systemic stability via rapid adaptation. Stripping their nation of dissent is in effect stripping it of the dynamics of successful adaptation and rapid evolution-- precisely the traits a nation needs to navigate eras of rapid change."

He concludes: "Many and perhaps most nation-states will fail as their elites suppress dissent and new ideas that threaten their power but which ironically are the only means to evolve successfully to rapidly changing circumstances."

The same can be said of non-governmental organizations.
