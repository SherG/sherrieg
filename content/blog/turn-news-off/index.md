In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYDWfxqZeW4" target="blank">this video</a> Gavin de Becker and his colleagues make compelling arguments for turning the news off -- now. 

Some of the issues highlighted are:

* News stories based entirely on anonymous sources -- something which a couple of decades ago was rightly considered unethical in journalism. 
* Visual media has a different impact on people than reading text.
* The fabricated sense of urgency which corrodes trust and amplifies negative emotions can also prevent you from making sound decisions.

## False alarms and the drawbridge of perception

This video brought to mind something Gavin de Becker wrote years ago in his article "<a href="https://gdba.com/apocalypse-not-now/" target="blank">Apocalypse Not Now</a>." He points out that hyped threat warnings can cause us to "raise the very drawbridge of perception that we must cross in order to make successful predictions."

Here's that full passage: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Alarming words—whether spoken by some angry extremist or by our own public officials—cause people to react by going into a defensive posture, psychologically speaking. Though the words themselves can’t put us at any actual risk, uncertainty about risk causes alarm, and this causes a problem: When we are stunned or distracted we raise the very drawbridge—perception—that we must cross in order to make successful predictions.</p></div>

And here are some related quotes from the same article:

 <div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Fear is the currency of the threatener.</p></div>

 <div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Politicians and newsreaders often use the word threat as if it is interchangeable with hazard. Threats and hazards are two different things.</a></div>

 <div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>A lot of the warnings we’ve received from public officials might as well be threats themselves, for they have the same effect.</a></div>
  
 ### The Twitter Outrage Cycle
  
The video made me think about the seasons of threat-hypes our nation experiences, which unfortunately now feed into what I call the Twitter Outrage Cycle. 
  
On Twitter the alleged threats (often based on a faulty first draft of current events) are digested by individuals and immediately turned into micro-slices of contagious rage, where even the most admirable and delicate of people -- including the well-educated with PhDs -- descend into name-calling, 'screaming', and even calls for political violence.

Soon news stories appear -- about the Twitter reactions. The cycle goes on. Eventually, once most the facts are in on a story, the audience has long moved on, and the more reliable reports get comparatively little attention.

### Catastrophizing, Inc.

I think it's worth asking periodically: 

* Which threats are currently being pushed by politicians and media? 
* Are these threats being hyped? 
* How much of the news and political discourse is dedicated to catastrophizing?
* Why? Who benefits?
