One of the hottest topics in current affairs continues to be "polarization." This is often presented as a threat to the republic and a driving cause of decline in America. At minimum it's believed to be a harbinger of a imminent danger.

I'm skeptical of the idea that polarization itself is a problem. After all, Americans have always held strong opinions and disagreed vehemently with one another. 

Politics-based anger, fierce disagreements, and incivility are often thought of as indicators of the "polarization problem."

But we've had incivility (and worse) rear its ugly head in politics, since our founding.

"In the early American republic, political libel and slander were as common as whiskey and horseflies. Even the revered George Washington was vilified as a closet monarchist and worse, and his less temperate successor, John Adams, tossed some of his most vocal critics in jail. But in the annals of American political conflict, it’s hard to top the events of 1804, when Vice President Aaron Burr shot and killed the leader of the opposition party, Alexander Hamilton. 

The Civil War went beyond polarization, bringing politics to the battlefield. But during the succeeding decades, writes historian Mark Wahlgren Summers in <em>Party Games</em> (2004), presidential campaigns were fought like “Armageddon with brassbands,” as if victory for the other side would pitch the country into the abyss.

Sound familiar? 

To qualify as polarized, people must be divided into competing camps. Yet without a clear sense of what those camps stand for, it can hardly be surprising that social scientists have reached different conclusions about to what extent—and even whether—Americans disagree with one other. No one doubts that there are red states, which voted for Bush in 2000, and blue states, which voted for Al Gore. Nor can one ignore that there exist popular cable television talking heads who clash vehemently on every political issue under the sun. But there’s no civil war taking place in the United States, and we may be not nearly as divided as we were when
anti-Vietnam War protestors confronted supporters of the war in the 1960s and ’70s. 

As partisan and contentious as our news media have become, by another good measure of political division—the number of
Americans whose lives have been lost over political disagreements—we are at a relative low point in our history.

No wonder, then, that when political scientists examine the issue of
polarization, they come up with contradictory findings. Whatever the extent
of the culture war in the nation, there’s deep division among those of us
who take its pulse.

I think that's worth considering: 
* It's often unclear where the lines are drawn between citizen groups
* "Right" vs "left" is a low-definition sorting mechanism that doesn't begin to reflect the variety of political views, 
* And yet the "partisan media" are incredibly fractious. And those analyzing the populace are deeply divided. 

So perhaps we should ask whether partsian media clashes are being mistaken for the condition of the nation as a whole? Or, if they are shaping the experience of the nation, in trickle-down fashion.
